I need your assistance in refactoring this codebase to enhance its design, maintainability, and performance. Here's an overview of the project structure:

Source Tree:
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}} 
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`: 

{{code}}

{{/if}}
{{/each}}

Refactoring focus areas:
1. Apply SOLID principles
2. Improve separation of concerns
3. Reduce code duplication (DRY)
4. Enhance naming and readability
5. Increase modularity and reusability
6. Optimize performance
7. Remove dead or redundant code
8. Update to modern language features

Refactoring process:
1. Analyze current design and architecture
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Break down refactoring into manageable steps
4. Maintain existing functionality and pass tests
5. Extract reusable components where appropriate
6. Consider performance implications
7. Ensure code remains readable and maintainable

For each significant refactoring proposal, provide:
1. File path(s) and line number(s)
2. Current code description and rationale for refactoring
3. Explanation of proposed changes and their benefits
4. Updated code snippets with refactoring applied

After refactoring:
1. Share the updated codebase
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Add new unit tests if applicable

Please proceed with the refactoring and provide your recommendations and code changes.
