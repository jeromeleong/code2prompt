Guidelines for generating the pull request description:

1. Use the following template structure:
   ```markdown
   Title: [Concise and informative title]

   ## Summary
   [Brief overview of the changes and their purpose]

   ## Changes
   [Detailed list of key modifications]

   ## Impact
   [Description of the expected outcome and benefits]

   ## Testing
   [Information on how the changes were tested]

   ## Additional Notes
   [Any relevant context or background information]
   ```

2. Analyze the git diff and git log to understand the changes, but do not include the raw git log or diff in the description.

3. Provide accurate and helpful content based on your code analysis, explaining changes clearly for users who may not be familiar with implementation details.

4. For each significant change:
   - Mention relevant class names, function names, and file names.
   - Explain code changes, new features, or improvements concisely.

5. If README.md or CHANGELOG.md were modified, mention this without detailing the specific changes.

6. Ensure the description is clear, concise, and valuable for reviewers and project maintainers.

7. Use proper Markdown formatting for better readability.

8. If applicable, include information about testing procedures or demo instructions.

Present the pull request description in Markdown format. If you have any questions while generating the description, please ask.
