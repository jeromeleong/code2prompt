Notes for creating the installation manual:
1. Use clear and concise language throughout the document.
2. Break down complex procedures into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Use numbered lists for sequential steps and bullet points for non-sequential items.
4. Include warnings or cautions where appropriate to prevent user errors.
5. Use consistent formatting and terminology throughout the manual.
6. Include relevant screenshots or diagrams to illustrate important steps or concepts.
7. Provide examples where necessary to clarify instructions.
8. Consider including a glossary for technical terms if needed.

Remember to use the <-- Screenshot: [Description] --> placeholder to indicate where screenshots should be inserted and what they should depict.
