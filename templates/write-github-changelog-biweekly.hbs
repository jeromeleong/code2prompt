Generate high-quality bi-weekly CHANGELOGs for this project, suitable for GitHub hosting. Analyze the provided git log to understand changes made during the specified period.

Project Path: {{ absolute_code_path }}

{{#if git_log_date}}
Git log for the period:
```
{{ git_log_date }}
```
{{/if}}

Guidelines for generating the CHANGELOGs:

1. Generate CHANGELOGs for all bi-weekly periods covered by the git log.

2. Use fixed date ranges for each period:
   - First half of the month: YYYY-MM-01 to YYYY-MM-14
   - Second half of the month: YYYY-MM-15 to YYYY-MM-30/31 (or 28/29 for February)

3. If there are no logs for a specific fixed date range, skip generating a CHANGELOG for that period.

4. Present each CHANGELOG content within a code block for easy distinction and copying.

5. For each period, include the following sections:
   - **Date Range**: [Start date] to [End date]
   - **Summary of Changes**: Brief overview of significant updates
   - **Detailed Changes**:
     - Added
     - Changed
     - Deprecated
     - Removed
     - Fixed
     - Security
   - **Contributors**: List of contributors during this period

6. For the Summary and Detailed Changes:
   - Focus on significant, user-facing changes
   - Avoid redundancy and overly technical details
   - Use clear, concise language

7. Exclude all content related to README.md and CHANGELOG.md from the CHANGELOG details.

8. Use proper Markdown formatting for improved readability.

9. Base the content on your analysis of the git log, inferring reasonable details if necessary.

10. Explain changes clearly for users unfamiliar with implementation details.

11. Ensure the CHANGELOGs are professional, factual, and not fictitious.

Present each CHANGELOG in this format:

```markdown
# CHANGELOG

## [Start date] to [End date]

### Summary of Changes
[Brief overview of main updates]

### Detailed Changes

#### Added
- [List of new features or functionalities]

#### Changed
- [List of modifications to existing features]

#### Deprecated
- [List of features marked for future removal]

#### Removed
- [List of removed features or functionalities]

#### Fixed
- [List of bug fixes]

#### Security
- [List of security-related improvements]

### Contributors
- [List of contributors]
```

Generate CHANGELOGs for all applicable bi-weekly periods, starting from the earliest date in the git log to the latest date. Separate each CHANGELOG with a horizontal line (---) for clarity.
