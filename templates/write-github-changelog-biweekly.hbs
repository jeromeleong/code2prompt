Generate a high-quality bi-weekly CHANGELOG for this project, suitable for GitHub hosting. Analyze the provided git log to understand changes made during the specified period.

{{/if}}

Guidelines for generating the CHANGELOG:

1. Present the CHANGELOG content within a code block for easy distinction and copying.

2. Include the following sections:
   - **Date Range**: [Start date] to [End date]
   - **Summary of Changes**: Brief overview of significant updates
   - **Detailed Changes**:
     - Added
     - Changed
     - Deprecated
     - Removed
     - Fixed
     - Security
   - **Contributors**: List of contributors during this period

3. For the Summary and Detailed Changes:
   - Focus on significant, user-facing changes
   - Avoid redundancy and overly technical details
   - Use clear, concise language

4. Exclude all content related to README.md and CHANGELOG.md from the CHANGELOG details.

5. Use proper Markdown formatting for improved readability.

6. Base the content on your analysis of the git log, inferring reasonable details if necessary.

7. Explain changes clearly for users unfamiliar with implementation details.

8. Ensure the CHANGELOG is professional, factual, and not fictitious.

Present the CHANGELOG in this format:

```markdown
# CHANGELOG

## [Start date] to [End date]

### Summary of Changes
[Brief overview of main updates]

### Detailed Changes

#### Added
- [List of new features or functionalities]
