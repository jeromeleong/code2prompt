Generate the CHANGELOG content in a code block for easy distinction and copying. The CHANGELOG should include the following sections:

1. **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
2. **Summary of Changes**: Brief overview of the main changes and updates made on this date.
3. **Detailed Changes**:
   - **Added**: New features, files, or functionalities
   - **Changed**: Modifications to existing features or files
   - **Deprecated**: Features or functionalities marked for future removal
   - **Removed**: Features, files, or functionalities that have been removed
   - **Fixed**: Bug fixes
   - **Security**: Security-related fixes or improvements
4. **Contributors**: List of contributors who made changes on this date

Guidelines:
- Exclude all content related to README.md and CHANGELOG.md from the CHANGELOG.
- Provide accurate and helpful content based on your analysis of the git log and git diff.
- Explain changes clearly for users who may not be familiar with implementation details.
- Avoid redundancy in listings.
- Infer reasonable details if needed, but prioritize information from the git log and git diff.
- Ensure the CHANGELOG is professional, factual, and not fictitious.

Present the CHANGELOG in Markdown format within a code block. If you have any questions while generating the CHANGELOG, please ask.
